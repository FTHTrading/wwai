# Final Client Share Checklist

Run this list before sending the demo URL to any external person. Sign and date it.

## 1. Pages render and navigate

- [ ] `/` — TROPTIONS + WWAI explained, no protected marks, no emoji
- [ ] `/wwai` — concierge demo loads, language picker works, presets respond
- [ ] `/client-demo` — every step link opens its target page in the same tab
- [ ] `/packages` — all package cards render with price, best-for, includes, CTA
- [ ] `/register` and each subroute — form renders, validation triggers
- [ ] `/area-guide` — content renders, no blank panels
- [ ] `/map` — map loads (live MapLibre when configured, demo SVG otherwise)
- [ ] `/safety-routes` — route planner runs, status line + provider chip render, indoor `VenueMap` placeholder shows below
- [ ] `/proposals` — package selection, term, add-ons, live total all update
- [ ] `/billing` — DemoGate prompts; after unlock, console + DemoWarning + provider chips render
- [ ] `/admin` — DemoGate prompts; after unlock, submissions list, filters, status buttons work
- [ ] `/settings/integrations` — DemoGate prompts; after unlock, all provider rows render with status chips
- [ ] `/launch` — DemoGate prompts; after unlock, checklist sections render

## 2. Critical CTAs

- [ ] Homepage hero buttons → land on the right page
- [ ] `/packages` `Register` button → `/register/<type>`

- [ ] `/proposals` `Contact Sales` → `/contact`
- [ ] `/proposals` `View Billing` → `/billing`
- [ ] `/admin` approve / needs_info / reject → updates the row immediately

## 3. Forms

For each `/register/<type>`:
- [ ] required fields enforce validation
